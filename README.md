# Brain Tumor Detection System (MATLAB App Designer)

This is a simple **GUI-based Brain Tumor Detection System** developed as part of a course project.  
The application is built in **MATLAB App Designer** and uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier** to detect brain tumors from MRI images.

## 🚀 Features
- Load MRI dataset (Tumor / No Tumor)  
- Train an SVM model with extracted statistical and texture features  
- Test new MRI images with tumor detection results  
- User-friendly GUI with image display, results panel, and status updates  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains a total of **3,123 MRI brain images** categorized into:  
- **Tumor Present (Yes):** 2,630 images  
- **No Tumor (No):** 493 images
